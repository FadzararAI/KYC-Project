# Software Engineering - KYC System

KYC (Know-Your-Client) is a project inspired by banks procedure to get information regarding a new customer. The purpose is to verify and validate the identity of customers to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and reduce risks like fraud, money laundering, or identity theft.

In this project, I am responsible for creating the entire system as a website. To be more specific, I am responsible for creating both the front-end and the back-end of the system as well as designing fundamental diagrams to achieve our objectives.

## Technologies
This KYC project uses **Native PHP** as the backend and **HTML + Tailwind CSS** as the front-end. Additionally, **Javascript** is also used to show the tables using DataTables from the database and also a little bit part for the back-end alongside PHP.

I also simulate RESTful API in some of the PHP code that connects to the MySQL Database. It's a bit messy so feel free to look for them yourself.

# Diagrams
## Case Diagram

I designed the case diagram as a start before creating the project in order to have consistent objectives based on our brainstorms and the project requirements.

## Relational Database Diagram

I also designed the database to begin with to approximate the procedures/functionalities of the KYC project.

# Screenshots
